Advanced motion profile and PID
===============================

A work in progress.

Some of the code (slightly reworked) from my linear lift.  
This code uses trapezoidal motion profiles and PID.  It assumes that the lift has been balanced using
rubber bands (or similar) to remove the effects of gravity.
